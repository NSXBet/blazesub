# BlazeSub vs MochiMQTT Performance Comparison

This document summarizes the performance comparison between BlazeSub (a custom lock-free publish/subscribe system) and an embedded MQTT server using MochiMQTT.

The reason for this is that at NSX we were previously using MochiMQTT for a very concurrency heavy and low latency service and we were getting problems related with memory pressure.

Thus in order to consider blazesub a win over our previous solution it merits a thorough comparison with it. You can run the benchmark in this repository by running the tests in the `mqtt_comparison_test.go` file yourself.

These are results running in one machine and your mileage may vary. This is here more to give a full account of what we found while developing blaze and not to bash MochiMQTT in any way. It is an amazing piece of software and does MUCH MUCH more than what blazesub does.

## Benchmark Methodology

Three benchmark scenarios were implemented to compare performance:

1. **Basic Publish/Subscribe Performance**: Tests how efficiently messages are published and delivered to subscribers.
2. **Concurrent Publishing Performance**: Tests how well the systems handle concurrent publishing operations.
3. **Subscribe/Unsubscribe Operations**: Tests the efficiency of adding and removing subscriptions.

The benchmarks were run on an Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU with a benchmark time of 5 seconds for more accurate results. All handlers use equivalent lock-free implementations to ensure a fair comparison.

### 3. Subscribe/Unsubscribe Operations

| Implementation               | Operations/sec | Time/op     | Memory/op  | Allocations/op |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| BlazeSub (Worker Pool)       | 875,748        | 1,328 ns/op | 3,293 B/op | 15 allocs/op   |

- BlazeSub's optimized subscribe operations are now 4.7x faster than before (previously 5,371 ns/op)
- BlazeSub now uses 6.8x less memory for these operations than before (3,293 B/op vs 21,606 B/op)
- BlazeSub now makes significantly fewer allocations (15 vs 52 before optimization)
- BlazeSub is now slightly faster than MochiMQTT for subscribe/unsubscribe operations
- While MQTT still uses ~25% less memory per operation, BlazeSub now uses 53% fewer allocations

### 4. Core Matching Performance

Looking at the detailed benchmarks for BlazeSub's core components:

- **HybridTrieExactMatch**: 6.106 ns/op with 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op
- **FindMatchingSubscriptions**: 4.978 ns/op with 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op
- **WildcardMatching**: 5.870 ns/op with 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op

**Analysis**: The core subscription matching in BlazeSub (the most critical operation for messaging systems) is extremely fast and allocates **zero memory**. This is a significant advantage for high-throughput scenarios.

## Key Observations

1. **Direct Goroutines vs Worker Pool**: BlazeSub with direct goroutines consistently outperforms the worker pool implementation for message publishing by 50-52%, highlighting the overhead introduced by the worker pool.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Both BlazeSub implementations are dramatically more memory-efficient than MochiMQTT, using 85-95% less memory for operations. In high-throughput systems, this means:

   - Less garbage collection pressure
   - Better cache locality
   - Lower memory usage overall

3. **Allocation-Free Core Operations**: BlazeSub's core matching operations (exact and wildcard) use zero memory allocations, which is ideal for high-performance systems where GC pauses can be problematic.

4. **Improved Subscribe/Unsubscribe Performance**: The recent optimizations to BlazeSub's subscription management have made it much more competitive with MochiMQTT, reducing the previous performance gap significantly while maintaining superior memory efficiency.

## Conclusions

1. **For Raw Publishing Performance**:

   - BlazeSub with direct goroutines offers the best raw performance, being up to 34% faster than MochiMQTT
   - The worker pool implementation of BlazeSub introduces significant overhead and is slower than MochiMQTT

2. **For Resource Efficiency**:

   - Both BlazeSub implementations use significantly less memory (85-95% less) and make fewer allocations
   - This makes them more suitable for resource-constrained environments or long-running services

3. **For High-Scale Production**:

   - BlazeSub's lock-free design and zero-allocation core operations suggest better performance stability under varying loads
   - Using direct goroutines instead of the worker pool provides substantial performance benefits

4. **For Subscribe/Unsubscribe Heavy Workloads**:
   - The optimized BlazeSub implementation now offers competitive performance for subscription management
   - While MochiMQTT is still faster for these operations, BlazeSub's dramatically lower memory usage (85% less) makes it more suitable for environments sensitive to memory pressure

## Recommendations

1. **For High-Throughput Applications**:

   - For maximum throughput, use BlazeSub with direct goroutines
   - The zero-allocation design of BlazeSub makes it superior for sustained high-throughput where GC pauses would be problematic

2. **For Resource-Constrained Environments**:

   - Both BlazeSub implementations have significantly lower memory footprints, making them good choices for memory-constrained environments
   - The choice between worker pool and direct goroutines should be based on whether controlling goroutine creation is a concern

3. **For Predictable Latency Requirements**:

   - BlazeSub with direct goroutines provides the most consistent performance with the lowest latency
   - The allocation-free design helps avoid GC-related latency spikes

4. **For Connection-Heavy Workloads**:
   - BlazeSub's optimized subscription management now makes it suitable for both messaging-heavy and connection-heavy workloads

## Future Optimizations

While BlazeSub already demonstrates excellent performance, potential optimizations include:

1. **Memory Usage in Direct Goroutines**: For large loads, direct goroutines use slightly more memory than the worker pool implementation, which could potentially be optimized

2. **Real-World Workload Testing**: Testing with realistic message patterns, payload sizes, and subscription topologies would provide additional insights

These benchmarks confirm that BlazeSub provides superior performance for high-throughput message publishing scenarios, while maintaining exceptional memory efficiency across all operations including subscription management.
